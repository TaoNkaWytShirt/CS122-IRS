        <p>
          At the heart of the university, the library serves as the repository
          of knowledge, offering an array of services and resources to support
          the scholarly endeavors of the whole academic and research community.
          With the increasing number of research outputs across the institution,
          the University Library, in collaboration with the UPM Digital
          Transformation Project Team, developed an institutional repository, a
          digital platform for preserving and utilizing an institution's
          intellectual assets, particularly research outputs. The UPM
          Institutional Repository System (UPM IRS) is an integrated platform
          for collecting and disseminating the research outputs created by the
          university's faculty members, staff, and researchers. It also extends
          the reach of UPM's research outputs while ensuring long-term
          preservation.
